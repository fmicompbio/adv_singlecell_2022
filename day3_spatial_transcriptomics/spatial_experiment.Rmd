This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(zellkonverter)
library(SpatialExperiment)
library(ggspavis)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

```{r}
root_dir <- "/Users/giovanni.palla/Datasets/advomics"
ad <- readH5AD(paste0(root_dir,"/spatial_adata/V10F24-105_A1.h5ad"))
```

Look at the SpatialExperimentObject
```{r}
coords <- as.matrix(reducedDim(ad, "spatial"))
colnames(coords) = c("x","y")
spe <- SpatialExperiment(
    assay = assay(ad,"X"), 
    colData = ad@colData, 
    spatialCoords = coords,
)
spe[["sample_id"]] <- "V10F24-105_A1"
```

```{r}
path_img <- paste0(root_dir,"/V10F24-105_A1.png")
spe <- addImg(spe, 
    sample_id = "V10F24-105_A1", 
    image_id = "V10F24-105_A1",
    imageSource = path_img, 
    scaleFactor = 0.04155585, 
    load = TRUE)
```

```{r}
plotSpots(spe,annotate = "array_col",)
```

```{r}
plotVisium(spe,fill = "array_col",)
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
